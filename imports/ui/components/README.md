# HOW TO USE

Components are the building blocks of your app. They are reusable and can be used in different parts of your app. They are also the easiest way to make your app modular and easy to maintain.

## Creating a component

To create a component, create a new file in the `imports/ui/components` directory. The file name should be the name of the component. For example, if you want to create a component called `MyComponent`, create a file called `MyComponent.jsx`.

## Importing a component

To import a component, use the following syntax:

```javascript
import MyComponent from "/imports/ui/components/MyComponent";
```

## Using a component

To use a component, use the following syntax:

```javascript
<MyComponent />
```

## Passing props to a component

To pass props to a component, use the following syntax:

```javascript
<MyComponent prop1="value1" prop2="value2" />
```
